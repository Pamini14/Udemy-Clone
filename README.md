# Udemy-Clone
This project is a front-end clone of the Udemy website built using HTML and CSS.
It replicates the layout and design of the Udemy homepage.
CSS Flexbox is used extensively to create structured and responsive layouts.
Flexbox helps align elements such as navigation bars, course cards, and sections.
The project includes a responsive navigation bar and multiple course sections.
Course cards are designed with proper spacing, alignment, and styling.
The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes.
Semantic HTML elements are used for a clean and organized structure.
No external frameworks or libraries were used in this project.
This project strengthened my understanding of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and responsive design.
